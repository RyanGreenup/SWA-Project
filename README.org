* TODO Add Members as Collaborators
+ [X] Ryan
+ [X] Kieran
+ [ ] Navid
+ [ ] Hassan
+ [ ] Ben

* DONE Documentation
** DONE Make a Wiki
+ Probably MediaWiki because github wiki doesn't deal with LaTeX
  + Wiki.JS is another option
*** DONE Configure Usernames for /Apache2/ Server
I'm going to have to adjust the =/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf= in
order to have the mediawiki publically accessible.
**** put config under version control
I will also need to put [[/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf][the Apache Config]] under version control using ~stow~.

** DONE Make a Gitpage
+ The gitpage will be almost the same as the wiki, but, if there are any issues
  configuring ~mkdocs~ and using ~mkdocs gh-deploy~ then just:

+ add information to the Wiki
+ Update the docs on /GitHub/
  + File an issue on /GitHub/ so somebody else can build the docs

* DONE Make a Discord Server
** DONE Make a WebHook for Github Issues
Follow [[https://gist.github.com/jagrosh/5b1761213e33fc5b54ec7f6379034a22][These Instructions here]]
It seems like it is necessary to append ~/github~ at the end of the /Payload
URL/ as documented [[https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668][here]].

That link also suggested that the /Content type/ should be =application/json=.
** DONE Invite all Members
* DONE Share links on /Vuws/
Put the following links up on /Vuws/:
+ [X] Discord Server
+ [X] Github
+ [X] GitPage
+ [X] Wiki
* Correspondence
** Group Email
Hey guys,

+ I've made a /GitHub/ repo [[https://github.com/RyanGreenup/SWA-Project/blob/master/README.org][here]]
+ A corresponding /GitPage/ [[https://ryangreenup.github.io/SWA-Project/][here]]
  + It's being deployed from the =gh-pages= branch, built using =mkdocs= as
described [[https://ryangreenup.github.io/SWA-Project/documentation_methods.html][on the page]]
+ I also just put up a wiki on an /Apache Server/ [[http://121.210.19.69/DSWiki/index.php/Main_Page][here]] that can be used in
conjuction with the =gh-pages= branch.
  + /Github/ doesn't support /MathJax/ so unfourtunately the built in wiki isn't
    an option
  + Also I'm on cable so I can't get a static IP, hence if I have a power outage be
mindful that the link will change and I'll have to post up my new IP.
+ Finally I've made a discord server which you can access through [[https://discord.gg/NEYcDF][this invitation]]
  + I used a webhook so that /GitHub/ will post to that chat every time a push is
    made or an issue posted.
    + Remember you can commit without pushing so this shouldn't be too annoying.

I'll add everybody as Collaborators tomorrow, but /GitHub/ just went down for
maintenance so I'll have to do it later

Also there is a post on the discussion board dated =2019-09-17=, just disregard
that. I'll download the tweets tomorrow and push them to /GitHub/ so we can all
get started, I haven't decided on the company to use but it doesn't really matter.
* TODO Working
** TODO 8.1 Analysing friend and follower count
I like [[http://juanreyero.com/article/emacs/org-teams.html][this post]] on managing the work so let's use that.
*** DONE 1 Pull Tweets                                                        :ryan:

+This was easy, I chose /[[https://twitter.com/SquareEnix?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor][SquareEnix]]/ because I'm looking forward to /FFVII/ when
we finish this project :beers:+

Nope, it was all japanese, but /Ubisoft/ is uniqe word that will be really easy
to search for (/Bunnings/ would be good to, /Valve/ would be awful) I've just
stored my tokens here for reference as well.

Same as [[*5 Bootstrap a confidence interval][above]] pretty much, but you'll notice I attached some notes justifying my description of the confidence interval [[./docs/ConfIntNotes.pdf][here]].

Originally I tried the following as described in issue =#3=
#+begin_src R
tens     <- y[0    <= y & y < 100]
hundreds <- y[100  <= y & y < 1000]
oneK     <- y[1000 <= y & y < 1000]
twoK     <- y[2000 <= y & y < 1000]
threeK   <- y[3000 <= y & y < 1000]
fourK    <- y[4000 <= y & y < 1000]
fiveKp   <- y[5000 <= y & y < Inf]
#+end_src

but I didn't like that and changed it to this:

#+begin_src R
## Assign Categories
y_df <- data.frame(y)
y_df$cat[0       <= y_df$y & y_df$y < 100] <- "Tens"
y_df$cat[100     <= y_df$y & y_df$y < 1000] <- "Hundreds"
y_df$cat[1000    <= y_df$y & y_df$y < 2000] <- "1Thousands"
y_df$cat[2000    <= y_df$y & y_df$y < 3000] <- "2Thousands"
y_df$cat[3000    <= y_df$y & y_df$y < 4000] <- "3Thousands"
y_df$cat[4000    <= y_df$y & y_df$y < 5000] <- "4Thousands"
y_df$cat[5000    <= y_df$y & y_df$y < Inf] <- "5ThousandOrMore"

### Make a factor
y_df$cat <- factor(y_df$cat, ordered = FALSE)

### Determine Frequencies
y_freq <- table(y_df$cat) %>% as.matrix()
