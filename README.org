#+TITLE: SWA-Project
Github for Social Web Analytics

+ [[https://ryangreenup.github.io/SWA-Project/][Home Page]]

* TODO Add Members
How do I give them permission to edit this etc.

* TODO Documentation
** TODO Make a Wiki
+ Probably MediaWiki because github wiki doesn't deal with LaTeX
  + Wiki.JS is another option
*** TODO Configure Usernames for /Apache2/ Server
I'm going to have to adjust the =/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf= in
order to have the mediawiki publically accessible.
** TODO Make a Gitpage
+ The gitpage will be almost the same as the wiki, but, if anybody has an issue configuring ~mkdocs~ and using ~mkdocs gh-deploy~ then they can:

+ add information to the Wiki
+ Update the docs on /GitHub/
+ requast another group member to build the docs

* TODO Make a Discord Server
** DONE Make a WebHook for Github Issues
Follow [[https://gist.github.com/jagrosh/5b1761213e33fc5b54ec7f6379034a22][These Instructions here]]
It seems like it is necessary to append ~/github~ at the end of the /Payload
URL/ as documented [[https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668][here]].

That link also suggested that the /Content type/ should be =application/json=.
** TODO Invite all Members
* TODO Share links on /Vuws/
Put the following links up on /Vuws/:
+ [ ] Discord Server
+ [ ] Github
+ [ ] GitPage
+ [ ] Wiki
+ [ ] Invites for /GitHub Collaborator/
