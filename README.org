* TODO Add Members
How do I give them permission to edit this etc.

* TODO Documentation
** TODO Make a Wiki
+ Probably MediaWiki because github wiki doesn't deal with LaTeX
  + Wiki.JS is another option
** TODO Make a Gitpage
+ The gitpage will be almost the same as the wiki, but, if anybody has an issue configuring ~mkdocs~ and using ~mkdocs gh-deploy~ then they can:

+ add information to the Wiki
+ Update the docs on /GitHub/
+ requast another group member to build the docs

* TODO Make a Discord Server
** TODO Make a WebHook for Github Issues
