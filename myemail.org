Hey guys,

I downloaded the friends and users for the Network and started on building the
graph, all we really need to do now is:

1. Compute the Closeness Centrality Score for each user
2. Find the 3 most central users
3. Conclude the Network stuff in the report
4. Proof Read the Report



Cheers,
Ryan.
