  abstract = {Marvel Comics is the brand name and primary imprint of Marvel Worldwide Inc., formerly Marvel Publishing, Inc. and Marvel Comics Group, a publisher of American comic books and related media.  In 2009, parents The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Entertainment, Marvel Worldwide's parent company.
Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman under a number of corporations and imprints but now known as Timely Comics, and by 1951 had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel era began in 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been used over the years, was solidified as the company's primary brand.
Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Captain America, the Wasp, Wolverine, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, Blade, Daredevil and the Punisher. Superhero teams exist such as the Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and the Guardians of the Galaxy as well as supervillains including Doctor Doom, Magneto, Thanos, Ultron, Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Red Skull, Loki, Venom, Dormammu, Galactus,  and Kingpin. Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major characters are based in New York City.  Additionally, Marvel has published several licensed properties from other companies. This includes Star Wars comics twice from 1977 to 1986 and again since 2015.},

  abstract = {Reading on the World Wide Web has become a daily habit nowadays. This can be seen from the perspective of changes in readers' tendency to be more interested in materials from the internet, than printed media. Taking these developments into account, it is important for web-based instructional designers to choose the appropriate font, especially for long blocks of text, in order to enhance the level of readability for students. Accordingly, this study aims to evaluate the effects of serif and sans serif fonts in the category of screen fonts and print fonts, in terms of Malay text readability on websites. For this purpose, four fonts were selected, namely Georgia (serif) and Verdana (sans serif) for the first respondents and Times New Roman (serif) and Arial (sans serif) for the second respondents. Georgia and Verdana were designed for computer screens display. Meanwhile, Times New Roman and Arial were originally designed for print media. A readability test on a computer screen was conducted on 48 undergraduates. Overall, the results showed that there was no significant difference between the readability of serif and sans serif font of both screen display category and print display category. Accordingly, the research findings and the literature overview, suggest that Verdana followed by Georgia is the better choice in displaying long text on websites. Likewise, as anticipated, Times New Roman and Arial fonts provide good readability for print media, which reinforces their status as the printing font category. However, with the current computer screen capability, it can still be an alternative option for instructional web developers.},

  abstract = {Last decades have witnessed considerable growth in formation of collaborative networks in industry and services, as well as in the rest of society. This trend is boosted by progress in information and communication technologies, and more specifically by ubiquitous access to computing and fast move toward the hyper-connected world. But, this growth has also raised fundamental questions regarding its effectiveness and sustainability of networks. On the other hand, nature is full of examples of successful collaborative processes, both intraand inter-species. Hence, we consider learning from nature to provide a promising strategy toward both better understanding of collaboration and more effective designing of networks with sustained collaboration. As such, a systematic literature survey is conducted on recent works originated in nature-related disciplines with a focus on collaboration. As a result, a set of important organizational models, collaborative behavior patterns, and collaboration facilitation mechanisms are identified and categorized. Furthermore, our analysis results on potential contribution of such aspects to more intelligent and optimized collaborative networks area are briefly outlined.},

  abstract = {Generalized reciprocity (help anyone, if helped by someone) is a minimal strategy capable of supporting cooperation between unrelated individuals. Its simplicity makes it an attractive model to explain the evolution of reciprocal altruism in animals that lack the information or cognitive skills needed for other types of reciprocity. Yet, generalized reciprocity is anonymous and thus defenseless against exploitation by defectors. Recognizing that animals hardly ever interact randomly, we investigate whether social network structure can mitigate this vulnerability. Our results show that heterogeneous interaction patterns strongly support the evolution of generalized reciprocity. The future probability of being rewarded for an altruistic act is inversely proportional to the average connectivity of the social network when cooperators are rare. Accordingly, sparse networks are conducive to the invasion of reciprocal altruism. Moreover, the evolutionary stability of cooperation is enhanced by a modular network structure. Communities of reciprocal altruists are protected against exploitation, because modularity increases the mean access time, that is, the average number of steps that it takes for a random walk on the network to reach a defector. Sparseness and community structure are characteristic properties of vertebrate social interaction patterns, as illustrated by network data from natural populations ranging from fish to primates.},

  abstract = {Analyzing networks involves understanding the complex relationships between entities, as well as any attributes they may have. The widely used node-link diagrams excel at this task, but many are difficult to extract meaning from because of the inherent complexity of the relationships and limited screen space. To help address this problem we introduce a technique called motif simplification, in which common patterns of nodes and links are replaced with compact and meaningful glyphs. Well-designed glyphs have several benefits: they (1) require less screen space and layout effort, (2) are easier to understand in the context of the network, (3) can reveal otherwise hidden relationships, and (4) preserve as much underlying information as possible. We tackle three frequently occurring and high-payoff motifs: fans of nodes with a single neighbor, connectors that link a set of anchor nodes, and cliques of completely connected nodes. We contribute design guidelines for motif glyphs; example glyphs for the fan, connector, and clique motifs; algorithms for detecting these motifs; a free and open source reference implementation; and results from a controlled study of 36 participants that demonstrates the effectiveness of motif simplification.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is the main adrenal androgen, which mostly exists in a sulfated version (DHEAS). Both DHEA and DHEAS are metabolic intermediates in the biosynthesis of the male sex hormone testosterone. In men, testosterone is involved in the regulation of fertility, libido, and muscle mass and is valuable for the assessment of gonadal, adrenal, and pituitary function and for the diagnosis of hypogonadism. The objective of the present study was to calculate age-specific reference ranges for serum DHEAS and serum testosterone using 1) linear regression and the mean {$\pm$} 1.96 standard deviation concept and 2) quantile regression. From the cross-sectional Study of Health in Pomerania a total of 1078 men aged 20\textendash{}79 years were included in the analyses. Serum DHEAS and testosterone levels were quantified using IMMULITE 2500 immunoassays. Linear and quantile regression were performed to calculate age-specific reference ranges. Both statistical methods generated different results: The reference ranges based on linear regression identified 17 men (1.6\%) with DHEAS levels and 45 men (4.2\%) with serum testosterone levels outside the reference range. Using quantile regression, 54 men (5.0\%) and 50 men (4.6\%) with serum DHEAS and testosterone levels outside the range were detected, respectively. The present study established age-specific reference ranges for serum DHEAS and testosterone levels for men. Quantile regression should be preferred to calculate reference ranges; a better concordance with original data is possible because no distribution assumption is required and the robustness against outliers is given.},

The main goal of this research is to measure the effects of font type and spacing of on screen text and its readability in improving and boosting the learner's ability to read easily, recall information, and enhance their reading speed and comprehension from on screen text with different topics. The readability of text on screens is necessary to ensure effective engagement in order to enhance the level of students' readability. For this purpose two font types were selected, Times New Roman (serif) and Verdana (san serif) for the respondents. Verdana was designed only for computer screens display. Readability test on a computer screen was conducted on 30 postgraduate students. Overall, the results showed that there was a significant difference between the readability of serif and san serif font type of on-screen display. The research findings suggest Verdana font type as a better choice in displaying long text for on-screen display.},

  abstract = {Lower testosterone levels in men are observationally associated with worse health, but it is unclear whether they contribute to well-established social gradients in health. Mendelian Randomization studies suggest positive testosterone-health associations may not be causal, with some intervention studies suggesting testosterone administration could be harmful. Since testosterone is rarely measured in general population studies, very little is known about how testosterone varies by social position. Differences by education and household income in British men aged 60-64y were recently reported, but it is unclear whether this reflects an influence of socioeconomic position (SEP) on testosterone, influence of testosterone on SEP, or confounding. In the UK Household Longitudinal Study, a nationally-representative survey of UK adults, we examine social differences in testosterone in 3663 men aged 16-97y in 2010\textendash{}12. We consider diverse dimensions of SEP: education, employment status, equivalized household income and personal earnings. Multivariable regression is used to explore social differences in testosterone across the adult life-span (16-97y). Secondly, Mendelian Randomization (MR), an approach which uses gene variants as instrumental variables for endogenous exposures, is used to investigate causal directionality. We examine associations with risk-taking, a plausible mediator of testosterone-SEP associations. In observational models no social differences in testosterone are seen, but MR models suggest a positive influence of testosterone on earnings (increase in log-transformed monthly earnings (GBP) per standard deviation increase in testosterone: 0.51, 95\%CI: 0.03,1.05, p = 0.07) and probability of being in work (probit coefficient:0.25, 95\%CI: 0.01,0.51, p = 0.06). Though MR estimates are less precise, results are consistent with previous literature linking testosterone with labour market success. The discrepancy may reflect suppression of observational associations by factors positively correlated with testosterone and negatively correlated with SEP, or indicate an influence of typical lifetime testosterone, which may be better indexed by genetic variants than by single testosterone measurements subject to noise.},

  abstract = {During an infectious disease outbreak people will often change their behaviour to reduce their risk of infection. Furthermore, in a given population, the level of perceived risk of infection will vary greatly amongst individuals. The difference in perception could be due to a variety of factors including varying levels of information regarding the pathogen, quality of local healthcare, availability of preventative measures, etc. In this work we argue that we can split a social network, representing a population, into interacting communities with varying levels of awareness of the disease. We construct a theoretical population and study which such communities suffer most of the burden of the disease and how their awareness affects the spread of infection. We aim to gain a better understanding of the effects that community-structured networks and variations in awareness, or risk perception, have on the disease dynamics and to promote more community-resolved modelling in epidemiology.},

In multivariable analysis, no association was found between TRT and overall prostate cancer risk (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.90 to 1.17). However, patients who received TRT had more favorable-risk prostate cancer (OR, 1.35; 95\% CI, 1.16 to 1.56) and a lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer (OR, 0.50; 95\% CI, 0.37 to 0.67). The increase in favorable-risk prostate cancer was already observed within the first year of TRT (OR, 1.61; 95\% CI, 1.10 to 2.34), whereas the lower risk of aggressive disease was observed after {$>$} 1 year of TRT (OR, 0.44; 95\% CI, 0.32 to 0.61). After adjusting for previous biopsy findings as an indicator of diagnostic activity, TRT remained significantly associated with more favorable-risk prostate cancer and lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer.ConclusionThe early increase in favorable-risk prostate cancer among patients who received TRT suggests a detection bias, whereas the decrease in risk of aggressive prostate cancer is a novel finding that warrants further investigation.},

Social networking sites allow users to manually categorize their friends into social circles (e.g. `circles' on Google+, and `lists' on Facebook and Twitter), however they are laborious to construct and must be updated whenever a user's network grows. We define a novel machine learning task of identifying users' social circles. We pose the problem as a node clustering problem on a user's ego-network, a network of connections between her friends. We develop a model for detecting circles that combines network structure as well as user profile information. For each circle we learn its members and the circle-specific user profile similarity metric. Modeling node membership to multiple circles allows us to detect overlapping as well as hierarchically nested circles. Experiments show that our model accurately identifies circles on a diverse set of data from Facebook, Google+, and Twitter for all of which we obtain hand-labeled ground-truth.},

UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},

Going beyond 2D is useful as we can utilize additional dimensions to present complex data sets but requires more user efforts to navigate/rotate to the appropriate views. Moreover, multidimensional visual analytics in immersed environments has not been fully explored. In this paper, we present a virtual reality model for visualizing multidimensional data in parallel coordinates, called VRParaSet. Our approach stacks polylines traveling in the similar paths between two consecutive dimensions. We anchor the lines at the vertices to reduce occlusions, offer esthetic appearance, and reveal data-based structures not evident in 2D panels or contours. The proposed model is compared to its 2D and 3D equivalences through a user study of 19 participants. The results show that the virtual reality model, while potentially useful, requires a lot of cares, especially on navigation and interaction within the virtual space.},

  abstract = {Long-term testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) up to 5 years has been shown to produce progressive and sustainable weight loss (WL) in hypogonadal men. This study investigated effects of long-term TRT up to 8 years in hypogonadal men with different obesity classes. From two independent observational registries we identified a total of 411 obese, hypogonadal men receiving TRT in urological clinics. The effects of TRT on anthropometric as well as metabolic parameters were studied for a maximum duration of 8 years, mean follow-up: 6 years. All men received long-acting injections of testosterone undecanoate in 3-monthly intervals. In all three classes of obesity, T therapy produced significant WL, decrease in waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI). In patients with class I obesity, mean weight decreased from 102.6{$\pm$}6.4 to 84.1{$\pm$}4.9\,kg, change from baseline: -17.4{$\pm$}0.5\,kg and -16.8{$\pm$}0.4\%. WC in this group of patients decreased from 106.8{$\pm$}7.4 to 95.1{$\pm$}5.3\,cm, change from baseline: -10.6{$\pm$}0.3\,cm. BMI decreased from 32.69{$\pm$}1.4 to 27.07{$\pm$}1.57, change from baseline: -5.52{$\pm$}0.15\,kg\,m-2. In patients with class II obesity, weight decreased from 116.8{$\pm$}6.9 to 91.3{$\pm$}6.3\,kg, change from baseline: -25.3{$\pm$}0.5\,kg and -21.5{$\pm$}0.4\%. WC decreased from 113.5{$\pm$}7.5 to 100.0{$\pm$}5.4\,cm, change from baseline: -13.9{$\pm$}0.4\,cm. BMI decreased from 37.32{$\pm$}1.45 to 29.49{$\pm$}1.71, change from baseline: -8.15{$\pm$}0.17\,kg\,m-2. In patients with class III obesity, weight decreased from 129.0{$\pm$}5.6 to 98.9{$\pm$}4.8\,kg, change from baseline: -30.5{$\pm$}0.7\,kg and -23.6{$\pm$}0.5\%. WC decreased from 118.5{$\pm$}5.6 to 103.8{$\pm$}4.9\,cm, change from baseline: -14.3{$\pm$}0.4\,cm. BMI decreased from 41.93{$\pm$}1.48 to 32.46{$\pm$}1.59, change from baseline -9.96{$\pm$}0.29\,kg\,m-2. Testosterone therapy appears to be an effective approach to achieve sustained WL in obese hypogonadal men irrespective of severity of obesity. Based on these findings we suggest that T therapy offers safe and effective treatment strategy of obesity in hypogonadal men.},

  abstract = {Obesity is a chronic disease, warranting long-term medical intervention. We evaluated effects of testosterone (T) therapy (Th) in men with T deficiency with normal weight, overweight and obesity on anthropometric and metabolic parameters, compared with untreated men. Hypogonadal men (n\,=\,823) with total T\,{$\leq$}\,12.1\,nmol/L (age: 60.6\,{$\pm$}\,7.0 years) participated in an ongoing registry study. Among these men 474 (57.6\%) were obese, 286 (34.8\%) overweight and 63 (7.7\%) had normal weight. T undecanoate injections were administered to 428 men and 395 remained untreated. Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were measured at least twice a year and changes adjusted for confounding factors to account for baseline differences between groups. Long-term TTh in hypogonadal men, irrespective of weight at baseline, produced improvements in body weight, waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, TTh decreased fasting blood glucose and HbA1c and improved lipid profiles. Gradual decreases in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse pressure occurred in men treated with T in each group. Marked reductions in mortality and major cardiovascular events were recorded in men receiving TTh. Our findings demonstrate that TTh produces reductions in weight, WC, and BMI. There were 77 (19.5\%) deaths in the untreated groups and 23 (5.4\%) in the T-groups. Based on these findings we suggest that long-term TTh in overweight and obese hypogonadal men produces progressive and sustained clinically meaningful weight loss and that TTh may contribute to reductions in mortality and incident major adverse cardiovascular events.},

  abstract = {The visualization of complex network traffic involving a large number of communication devices is a common yet challenging task. Traditional layout methods create the network graph with overwhelming visual clutter, which hinders the network understanding and traffic analysis tasks. The existing graph simplification algorithms (e.g. community-based clustering) can effectively reduce the visual complexity, but lead to less meaningful traffic representations. In this paper, we introduce a new method to the traffic monitoring and anomaly analysis of large networks, namely Structural Equivalence Grouping (SEG). Based on the intrinsic nature of the computer network traffic, SEG condenses the graph by more than 20 times while preserving the critical connectivity information. Computationally, SEG has a linear time complexity and supports undirected, directed and weighted traffic graphs up to a million nodes. We have built a Network Security and Anomaly Visualization (NSAV) tool based on SEG and conducted case studies in several real-world scenarios to show the effectiveness of our technique.},

This is of paramount importance because testosterone therapy in obese men with testosterone deficiency represents a novel and a timely therapeutic strategy for managing obesity in men with testosterone deficiency.
RECENT FINDINGS: Long-term testosterone therapy in men with testosterone deficiency produces significant and sustained weight loss, marked reduction in waist circumference and BMI and improvement in body composition. Further, testosterone therapy ameliorates components of the metabolic syndrome. The aforementioned improvements are attributed to improved mitochondrial function, increased energy utilization, increased motivation and vigor resulting in improved cardio-metabolic function and enhanced physical activity.
SUMMARY: The implication of testosterone therapy in management of obesity in men with testosterone deficiency is of paramount clinical significance, as it produces sustained weight loss without recidivism. On the contrary, alternative therapeutic approaches other than bariatric surgery failed to produce significant and sustained outcome and exhibit a high rate of recidivism. These findings represent strong foundations for testosterone therapy in obese men with testosterone deficiency and should spur clinical research for better understanding of usefulness of testosterone therapy in treatment of underlying pathophysiological conditions of obesity.},

This study examined predictors of university student satisfaction with life, academic self-efficacy, and self-reported academic achievement in their first year of university. First-year students (n = 66) completed selfreport measures of academic achievement, university well-being, satisfaction with life, personality, and mental health. A linear regression analysis approach was applied to the data. Results indicated that academic satisfaction and school connectedness predicted satisfaction with life but that academic self-efficacy and college gratitude did not, conscientiousness predicted academic self-efficacy, college well-being predicted self-reported achievement, and anxiety predicted achievement but depression did not.

  abstract = {Understanding personal factors that contribute to university student satisfaction with life is important in order to determine how we can better prepare students for the transition to post-secondary education and support them during this transition. This study examined predictors of university student satisfaction with life, academic self-efficacy, and self-reported academic achievement in their first year of university. First-year students (n = 66) completed selfreport measures of academic achievement, university well-being, satisfaction with life, personality, and mental health. A linear regression analysis approach was applied to the data. Results indicated that academic satisfaction and school connectedness predicted satisfaction with life but that academic self-efficacy and college gratitude did not, conscientiousness predicted academic self-efficacy, college well-being predicted self-reported achievement, and anxiety predicted achievement but depression did not. This study highlights the importance of understanding the personal factors that influence well-being and achievement during the transition to university.
